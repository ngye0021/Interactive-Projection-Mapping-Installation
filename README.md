# Interactive-Projection-Mapping-Installation
An Interactive Projection Mapping Installation titled 'STRINGS' which utilises Arduino, Processing & Madmapper to combine technical and visuals, ultimately producing a main housing unit with touch sensors which audiences can interact with and its interacted animations being projection mapped onto a secondary 3D structure in real time.
